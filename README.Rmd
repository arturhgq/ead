The goal of ead is to estimate episodes of regime change using v-DEM data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ead like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("arturhgq/ead")
```

## What is ead?

`ead` is a Portuguese acronym for episodes of autocratisation and democratisation. Within this package, the `ead_typology` function codify six different types of regime change: autocracy deepening, democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, liberalization, democratic transition and democratic deepening. The tipology is heavily based on LÃ¼hrmann et al. (2018) and Maerz et al. (2021) research and is fully described in my master's thesis. 

##  How to use it? 

If you are interested in estimating episodes of regime change yourself, using customs parameters, see the vignette ["How to use ead?"](articles/How-to-use-ead-.html).

## Acknowledgments

I thank the Political Science department at UFMG for the encouragement and support and FAPEMIG for funding my research.
