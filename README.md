The goal of ead is to estimate episodes of regime change using v-DEM
data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ead like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("arturhgq/ead")
```

## What is ead?

`ead` is a Portuguese acronym for episodes of autocratisation and
democratisation. Within this package, the `typology` function codify
six different types of regime change: autocracy deepening, democratic
backsliding, democratic breakdown, liberalization, democratic transition
and democratic deepening. The tipology is heavily based on Lührmann et
al.(2018) and Maerz et al.(2021) research and is fully described in my
master’s thesis.

## How to use it?

If you are interested in estimating episodes of regime change yourself,
using customs parameters, see the vignette [“How to use
ead?”](articles/How-to-use-ead-.html).

## Acknowledgments

I thank the Political Science department at UFMG for the encouragement
and support and FAPEMIG for funding my research.
